    "- Columns containing categories with only two factors must be stored as Booleans (bool).\n",
    "- Columns containing integers only must be stored as 32-bit integers (int32).\n",

    "- Columns containing nominal categorical data must be stored as the category data type.\n",
    "- Columns containing ordinal categorical data must be stored as ordered categories, and not mapped to numerical values, with an order that reflects the natural order of the column.\n",
